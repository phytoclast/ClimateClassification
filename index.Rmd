*Abstract:*

> Climate is an important factor in determining the broad patterns of species distribution and potential vegetation. But when similar or adjacent sites with similar soils are compared, it is not clear what if any difference in climate is responsible for differences in site potential. Ecological site descriptions commonly feature monthly and annual precipitation and temperature in climate descriptions and graphs. However, there is wide overlap among these parameters even where temperature and moisture are the primary drivers for the differences among vegetation types.
I propose several different parameters which have a better relationship to vegetation differences. Available moisture can only be determined when the timing of the inputs of precipitation and the outputs of potential evapotranspiration (PET) are considered with respect to growing season. Temperature can be understood both terms of optimal physiological activity, and lethal tissue limitations. The proposed parameters retain a connection to real world measurement units and are not obscure unitless indices derived from complex relationships. A Shiny application was developed to illustrate alternative graphs with which to compare different regions of the country. Maps were produced to illustrate the distribution of suggested classification intervals of the parameters.


> Seven climate indices were calculated to provide a base for an alternative climate classification and be physiologically informative for plant distribution modeling. The indices retain in real world units that can be directly related to climate change. The larger categories of the classification approximate major vegetation formations, but the indices can be subdivided into smaller, regular increments without the presumption that any given threshold implies precision in interpretation.

**Growing Season Temperature** is the positive average temperature of the warmest 6 months (any sub-freezing months are counted as zeros). Körner (1998) demonstrated that the cold limits of forest growth across a wide range of latitudes share a growing season temperature of 6 to 7°C. In contrast, neither growing season length, growing degree days, nor the mean temperatures of a single month or a whole year was found to be a good fit to the timberline distribution. Plant form and function is optimized according to temperatures likely to maximize productivity during the peak months, whereas the conditions during non-optimal months will determine adaptive strategies such as the persistence of leaves or stems.

Previous attempts at pinning timberline to a highest monthly mean temperature of 10°C (e.g. the Köppen-Geiger system, Kottek et al, 2006), and Holdridge’s (1947) mean annual biotemperature of 3°C are most successful if applied only to middle and high latitudes. But in tropical mountains, where the annual range in monthly temperature is small, the highest forests grow where maximum monthly mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures converge toward 6°C. This temperature threshold can be realized at higher latitude timberlines simply by calculating the positive temperature for the warmest six months, instead of for the whole year.

Vegetation zonation at warmer temperatures should also be expected to follow a growing season optimum according to each species, except where critical thresholds of cold or drought tolerances are exceeded. Examples can be seen where crops and tree genera associated with the temperate zone are found in the premontane and montane zones of tropical mountains where warm seasons are comparable whereas winters are very different. The greater the growing season temperature, the lower the risk in producing larger more efficient leaves. At cooler temperatures, the seasonal advantage of broadleaves is lost relative to advantage of being evergreen, maximizing the available opportunities for photosynthesis. A growing season temperature between 12 and 15°C is the transition zone between the warmer temperate deciduous and the cooler boreal evergreen forest zones, and happens also to be the limit in viability of most crops.

![Figure 1: Relationship of temperature with elevation showing the potential elevation of the timberline 6°C in the southern Appalachian would be almost 1000m above the highest peaks, and therefore unrelated to the the presence of balds on some peaks. Also shows that winter cold never reaches the winter cold limitation of any tree species before it runs out of summer warmth](figures/TemperatureElevation.png)

**Annual Extreme Low & Coldest Mean Monthly Temperature**

Cold temperature effects vegetation in two ways; it can simply be too cold for metabolic activity or it can damage tissues. The capability of evergreens to remain functional at a lower temperature must be balanced with the risk of damage by even colder temperatures or the loss in efficiency at warmer temperatures. Mean monthly temperature below freezing offers little advantage to an evergreen and risks desiccation due to frozen soils. Therefore, most evergreens in the temperate zone have thickened needle and scale leaves with small surface areas to avoid damage.

Where the coldest monthly means remain above freezing, broadleaf evergreen vegetation can be supported. However, most broadleaf evergreens, such as those found in subtropical climates, are damaged by where temperatures drop below -15°C (Prentice et al, 1992; Box 1996). Tropical vegetation is nearly intolerant of any freezing temperatures, and in some cases can be damaged by cold a few degrees above freezing.

The Köppen-Geiger system, for comparison, delineates subtropical and oceanic climate zones where mean temperature of the coldest month exceeds 0°C, while it designates a tropical climate zone where mean  monthly temperature exceeds 18°C. The Holdridge system does not address seasonality but rather uses annual biotemperature of 18°C and 24°C for subtropical and tropical zones respectively. The consensus among different systems maintaining subtropical or tropical climates above an 18°C threshold can be expressed by setting it as a lower limit of growing season temperature, below which an oceanic or tropical montane climates will prevail.

The synthesis of extreme cold and average cold into a single index, offset by 15 degrees, was made to emphasize the effects of winter extremes in the continental northern hemisphere, while focusing on metabolic limitations where extreme temperatures are lacking in the oceanic southern hemisphere.
The modal vegetation difference between temperate (continental) and subtropical and tropical vegetation is the presence of broadleaf evergreen species and palms. Accordingly, the threshold between the subtropical and temperate (continental) climates should pivot around the more limiting value of 0°C coldest monthly temperature and -15°C annual extreme low temperature. The boundary between frost intolerant tropical vegetation and frost tolerant subtropical vegetation is logically set at 0°C annual extreme low temperature, with the corresponding 15°C coldest monthly temperature. Setting the coldest mean monthly temperature at 18°C to match the Köppen-Geiger system for locations like south Florida is not neccissary, as the temperature of annual extreme low is reaches 0°C near there. On the other hand, setting the boundary as only related to extreme temperatures would result in southern Australian coast being deamed as tropical rather than subtropical.

The oceanic climate is conflated with the tropical montane climate, without making any allowance for latitude or elevation in the classification. One possible climatic distinction is that a temperate oceanic climate is subject to annual frost, whereas the threat of frost is missing from a tropical montane climate A frost free climate is assumed for tropical montane forests by Faber-Langendoen et al (2012), but the threat of frost is assumed to be the boundary between the tropical montane and premontane forest according to Holdridge (1947) at roughly the 18°C biotemperature. In equatorial regions, the frost may hold off until the 12°C subalpine zone, whereas away from the equator the frost line approaches the bottom of the 18°C montane zone. However, there are still oceanic climates along the Australian and California coasts which are nearly frost free. 


The cold index can be tuned further to subdivide the temperate (continental) climates. While most of the zonation will pivot on limitations to growing season warmth, there are some limits on groups of taxa. The hardiness of boreal species tends to be almost unlimited, whereas most temperate deciduous genera persist only down to -40°C (Prentice et al, 1992; Box 1996; Sakai & Weiser, 1973). The diversity of temperate deciduous species drops sharply where annual extreme lows fall below -25°C (Sakai & Weiser, 1973).

**P/PET Ratio**

Mesophytic vegetation requires a constant supply of soil moisture, whereas xerophytic vegetation tolerates periods of drought. Mesophytic forests typically occur where mean annual precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration ratio (P/PET ratio), meaning that seasonal dry periods are more than compensated for by seasonal surpluses stored as soil moisture to maintain plant growth. Gradations in moisture regime are usually expressed on a log base 2 scale (e.g. Holdridge), from per-humid and per-arid at its wet and dry extremes respectively.

**Surplus & Deficit**

Even in a humid climate, significant seasonal drought occurs where the cumulative loss of moisture evapotranspiration exceeds that of available soil water holding capacity within the rooting zone. A deficit of 150 mm or more is considered significant for most soils and would require adaptations of thickened leaves or deciduousness to protect a plant from drying out. Desert vegetation may occur where precipitation is less than half required to maintain soil moisture, and that significant seasonal surpluses do not support seasonal growth of mesophytic vegetation. Instead, desert vegetation must avail themselves with episodic rainfall that never wets the whole soil profile.

![Figure 3: Comparision between a humid isopluvial climate (MLRA 98A) and a perhumid xerothermic climate (MLRA 1), showing that significant moisture stress can be more likely in the wetter climate if soil water holding capacity is less than the total moisture deficit.](figures/MoistureDroughtCompare.png)

**Peak AET** For climates with seasonal variability in moisture, plants must employ a strategy of either tolerance or avoidance to survive the dry season. The timing of the dry season, however is of less importance compared the timing of the wet season. If the wet season coincides with temperatures favoring maximum growth, the strategy is avoidance, allowing annual regrowth of more efficient deciduous organs optimized for higher peak productivity. In contrast, if moisture is only available during periods of lower temperatures, the strategy is tolerance, allowing persistence through long periods of low productivity. In addition, when warm temperatures coincides with precipitation, the frequency of lightning is higher and fire return inverval is shorter, further giving advantage to grassland vegetation over shrubland.

Actual monthly evapotranspiration (AET) is an indicator of how much precipitation of the current month is used in that month.  A minimally tropical month at 15°C would generally result in a PET of at least 75 mm. Therefore, a tropical rainy should have a peak monthly AET of greater than or equal to 75 mm. Plants in seasonally moist climates with peak AET less than 75 mm either lack a warm season, or are moist only during the cool season.

![Figure 4: Comparision between a subtropical prairie climate (MLRA 78A) and a chapparal climate (MLRA 14), showing how peak AET is the key difference.](figures/pAET_Compare.png)



**A note on estimating annual extreme low temperatures** Most available climatic data sets consist of averaged monthly values and lack sufficient information on temperature extremes. In order to estimate annual extreme low temperature, I consulted a couple of sources (Magarey, Borchert, & Schlegel, 2008; Daly et al., 2012) which generated gridded hardiness zone data. I then sampled points from these grids to associate with mean monthly temperature parameters from another gridded source of the appropriate timeframe 
(Hijmans et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2008) and developed a linear model. The linear model related annual extreme low temperatures with mean daily low temperatures, latitude, and altitude. I refined the model further by introducing a set of regional correction factors based on distance from specific latitudes and longitudes.

**A note on PET equations** Potential evapotranspiration is a function of temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure (Lu, McNulty, & Amatya, 2005). The Holdridge method is the simplest method, by simply multiplying annual biotemperature by 58.93, but is never used for serious applications beyond climate classification. The Thornthwaite method was an earlier attempt at estimating PET that used only monthly mean temperature, and used day length as a proxy for solar radiation. Formulas that use daylength for solar radiation that do not account for lower sun angles (e.g. Thornthwaite) may also over estimate PET at high latitudes with 24 hour sunshine. The interpretability monthly values using the Thorntwaite method is also complicated by division by a “heat index” which is based on an annual temperature total, rendering some values in the arctic region to be anomalously high. Priestly-Taylor method is considered among the more accurate (Lu, McNulty, & Amatya, 2005), consisting of elements of each of these factors (Details can be found here: http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e07.htm#solar%20radiation or http://modeling.bsyse.wsu.edu/CS_Suite/cropsyst/manual/simulation/et/priestly_taylor.htm). Employing all the needed parameters for a global map is impracticable. Hargreaves-Samoni method reduces the number of required parameters by using daily temperature range as a proxy for cloud cover and relative humidity. I followed a hybrid approach using temperature, daily temperature range, and a formula for calculating shortwave solar radiation. I calibrated the formula against values from the Thornthwaite method in the north temperate zone where it is widely employed. This approach falls short of the Thornthwaite method in cool or humid climates and exceeds it in arid regions with a wide daily temperature ranges.

###Variables and formulae as used in the keys above

**Tc** = mean temperature of the coldest month

**Tg** = mean positive (subzero temperatures counted as zero) temperature of the warmest 6 months

**P** = precipitation

**AET** = lesser value among monthly P and PET, approximating “actual evapotranspiration” without considering affects of soil moisture storage or runoff. **Peak AET** is the month with the highest value of AET.

**Deficit** = total monthly deficit is calculated by summing for the entire year each monthly amount of PET in excess of P (subtract P from PET if P is less than PET; zero if P ≥ PET).

**Surplus** = total monthly surplus is calculated by summing for the entire year each monthly amount of P in excess of PET (subtract PET from P if PET is less than P; zero if P <= PET).

####Monthly potential evapotranspiration:
$$PET = 0.008404 * 216.7*\frac{exp(17.26939*\frac{T}{T+237.3})}{T+273.3}*Ra*dM*(Tmax-Tmin)^{0.5}$$

*where*

**Declination:** $dec = 0.409*sin(2*\pi*Md/365 – 1.39)$

**Sunset Angle:** $hs = acos(-tan(Latitude/360*2*\pi) * tan(declination)) [-1\to 1]$

**Potential Solar Radiation:** $Ra = 117.5 * (hs*sin(Latitude/360*2*\pi)*sin(dec) + cos(Latitude/360*2*\pi)*cos(dec)*sin(hs)) /\pi$

**T** = mean monthly temperature

**Tmax** = mean monthly daily high temperature

**Tmin** = mean monthly daily low temperature

**Md** = mid-month day of year

**dM** = total days in month

**Simple approximation of monthly PET:** $$PET = 5 * BT$$

*where*

**BT** = positive mean monthly temperature $[0\to\infty]$ (values below zero set to zero) or “biotemperature”.

####Mean annual extreme low temperature (approximated):
$Tclx = -9.921 + 1.248*Tcl + -0.03829*L + 0.000904*A + -0.0000219 * L*A$

*where*

**Tcl** = low temperature of coldest month

**L** = latitude

**A** = altitude above sealevel

###Appendix: Climate Browsers

***
The **MLRA Climate Browser** (https://usda.shinyapps.io/MLRAClimate/) allows a user to compare and contrast the climates of up to two different MLRAs at a time for various climatic parameters. The default monthly temperature and preciptiation graph shows the relationship of preciptation with potential evapotranspiration. Both precipitation and temperature include error bars indicating the lowest and highest 6 out of 30 year record (20th and 80th percentiles) among the stations within the MLRA (shows both temporal and geographic variability).
